# Responsive Layout Exercise

Design a responsive, mobile-friendly version of this site on paper, then create your changes in code.

Think about these questions:

- What will you do to make the three-column area readable on smartphone screens?
- Should the header change?
- Are there details of spacing and type that you should adjust?
- Are the left and right margins still appropriate for small screens?
- How can you improve the navbar for mobile? (Do this last.)

The code structure is designed for clarity rather than for browser performance. (Notably, we break CSS out into several files, to help keep code organized.) Even so, the slowdowns will be insignificant for most student/personal sites, and the speed fixes are easy to make.

This project includes elements from HTML5 Boilerplate (see docs/h5bp/ for more).
