<h2> Impressionist Techniques </h2>

<p>French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the Romantic colourist Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, the leader of the realists Gustave Courbet, and painters of the Barbizon school such as Th&eacute;odore Rousseau. The Impressionists learned much from the work of Johan Barthold Jongkind, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Eug&egrave;ne Boudin, who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.</p>

<p>A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists&mdash;and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as Frans Hals, Diego Vel&aacute;zquez, Peter Paul Rubens, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner&mdash;the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. </p>

<p>These techniques include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied impasto.
	<li>Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of simultaneous contrast to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.</li>
	<li>Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing complementary colours. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.</li>
	<li>Wet paint is placed into wet paint without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.</li>
	<li>Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.</li>
	<li>The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds.</li>
	<li>The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce effets de soir&mdash;the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.</li>
	<li>In paintings made en plein air (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)</li>
</ul>

<p>New technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors. Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.</p>

<p>Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included cobalt blue, viridian, cadmium yellow, and synthetic ultramarine blue, all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism. The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as cerulean blue, which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.</p>

<p>The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground. By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting. By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.</p>

<p>Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such 17th-century Dutch painters as Jan Steen, had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of composition were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance. Photography was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.</p>

<p>The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and landscape paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography &quot;produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably.&quot;</p>

<p>In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused &quot;on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph&mdash;by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated.&quot; The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their &quot;tacit imperatives of taste and conscience.&quot; Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: &quot;The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph.&quot;</p>

<p> Another major influence was Japanese ukiyo-e art prints (Japonism). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the &quot;snapshot&quot; angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's Jardin &agrave; Sainte-Adresse, 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints.</p>

<p>Edgar Degas was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints. His The Dance Class (La classe de danse) of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the Little Dancer of Fourteen Years.</p>
