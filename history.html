	<p>Radicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix and J. M. W. Turner. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, still lifes and portraits as well as landscapes were usually painted in a studio. The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting en plein air. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short &quot;broken&quot; brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour&mdash;not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary&mdash;to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.</p>

	<p>Impressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the Macchiaioli, and Winslow Homer in the United States, were also exploring plein-air painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.</p>

	<p>The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.</p>

	<p>By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including Neo-Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.</p>

	<p>In the middle of the 19th century&mdash;a time of change, as Emperor Napoleon III rebuilt Paris and waged war&mdash;the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts dominated French art. The Acad&eacute;mie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Acad&eacute;mie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work. Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.</p>

	<p>The Acad&eacute;mie had an annual, juried art show, the Salon de Paris, and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Acad&eacute;mie, represented by the works of such artists as Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me and Alexandre Cabanel.</p>

	<p>In the early 1860s, four young painters&mdash;Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bazille&mdash;met while studying under the academic artist Charles Gleyre. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom. By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the Realism of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the Caf&eacute; Guerbois on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by &Eacute;douard Manet, whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by Camille Pissarro, Paul C&eacute;zanne, and Armand Guillaumin. </p>

	<p>During the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style. In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d&eacute;jeuner sur l'herbe) primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting. The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.</p>

	<p>After Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the Salon des Refus&eacute;s (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refus&eacute;s drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.</p>

	<p>Artists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refus&eacute;s in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, C&eacute;zanne, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas and several other artists founded the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme Coop&eacute;rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs (&quot;Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers&quot;) to exhibit their artworks independently. Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon. The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older Eug&egrave;ne Boudin, whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt plein air painting years before. Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, Johan Jongkind, declined to participate, as did &Eacute;douard Manet. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer Nadar.</p>

	<p>The critical response was mixed. Monet and C&eacute;zanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist Louis Leroy wrote a scathing review in the newspaper Le Charivari in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant), he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article The Exhibition of the Impressionists, Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.</p>

	<p>He wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers, &quot;Impression&mdash;I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.&quot;</p>

	<p>The term Impressionist quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together&mdash;albeit with shifting membership&mdash;eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.</p>

	<p>Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the &quot;purest&quot; Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors. Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. &Eacute;douard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader, never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour, and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting Spanish Singer had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that &quot;the Salon is the real field of battle&quot; where a reputation could be made.</p>

	<p> Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870), defections occurred as C&eacute;zanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and C&eacute;zanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy. Degas invited Mary Cassatt to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Raffa&euml;lli, Ludovic Lepic, and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of &quot;opening doors to first-come daubers&quot;. The group divided over invitations to Paul Signac and Georges Seurat to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.</p>

	<p>The individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, Durand-Ruel, played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879. Monet became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.</p>
